;;; Docstrings highlighting

;; Although `scheme-mode' has all the functionality to highlight
;; docstrings properly (with `font-lock-doc-face', not with
;; `font-lock-string-face'!), it doesn't do it.  The only missing thing
;; needed to fix it, is setting `font-lock-syntactic-face-function'.

;; XXX This is definitely an Emacs bug, and I should report about it!  I
;; think it was introduced by
;; <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=0a5cfeeecb9e1038f9df3b34b61b797e56213a7b>.

;; Another miss is that "scheme.el" contains "docstring rules" only for
;; `define' and `lambda*', while there are other things to highlight:

(put 'define* 'scheme-doc-string-elt 2)
(put 'lambda* 'scheme-doc-string-elt 2)
(put 'case-lambda 'scheme-doc-string-elt 1)
(put 'case-lambda* 'scheme-doc-string-elt 1)
(put 'define-syntax-rule 'scheme-doc-string-elt 2)
(put 'syntax-rules 'scheme-doc-string-elt 2)

(defun al/scheme-fix-docstring-font-lock ()
  "Fix highlighting of the Scheme docstrings.
This function is intended to be added to `scheme-mode-hook'."
  (setq-local font-lock-syntactic-face-function
              'lisp-font-lock-syntactic-face-function))
